## V1.6.0

Release Date: 2026-10-02

This release is a performance pass: the derived design token chain is shared across component instances, style hooks resolve the token once, the wrapper layers forward only the props that are actually set to `@v-c/*`, Table hands `@v-c/table` referentially stable column config, and the delayed style-removal timer no longer keeps unmounted component trees in memory. On a production build, 1000 Buttons hot-mount in 116 ms instead of 157 ms with the heap down from 92 MB to 48 MB, 200 DatePickers go from 368 ms to 156 ms, and a 1000-row Table cold-mounts in 225 ms instead of 439 ms. `@antdv-next/cssinjs` 1.1.0 ships alongside with new public APIs, and `@v-c/util`, `trigger`, `picker`, `select`, `table`, `menu` and `tooltip` move to their matching stable releases; since the dependency floor moves as a whole, this is a minor release. It also advances ant-design upstream tracking to `820e1a8c2d` and fixes a batch of Form validation, Alert, Drawer, Descriptions, ColorPicker and ConfigProvider issues; the IDE web-types are now generated from `global.d.ts` and cover all 128 global components.

**⚡ Performance**

All numbers are production builds on the same machine (Apple M2 Pro, Chrome 154), 3 pages × 5 hot mounts averaged, compared with 1.5.6:

| scene | instances | hot mount ms | heap MB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Button | 1000 | 157 → 116 | 92 → 48 |
| Input | 500 | 91 → 65 | 54 → 27 |
| Select | 500 | 305 → 200 | 80 → 77 |
| DatePicker | 200 | 368 → 156 | 61 → 47 |
| Menu (inline, 500 items) | 1 | 206 → 143 | 77 → 47 |
| Form (100 Form.Item + Input) | 1 | 84 → 57 | 40 → 21 |
| Table (1000 rows, cold mount) | 1 | 439 → 225 | 64 → 57 |
| typical admin page (menu + filter form + paginated table) | 1 | 50 → 38 | 18 → 13 |

* perf(theme): the derived design token is computed once per ConfigProvider / DesignTokenProvider / StyleProvider combination and shared by every component instance under it; previously each style hook rebuilt the whole derivation chain, and a Button paid for four of them. Computeds per component instance: Button 219 → 51, Input 263 → 65, FormItem + Input 901 → 178 (via `@antdv-next/cssinjs` 1.1.0)
* perf(theme): `genStyleHooks` resolves `useToken()` once and hands it to both the component style hook and the CSS variable register; `useStyleRegister` keeps a single computed (the cache path), `useBaseConfig` / `useComponentBaseConfig` return getter refs, and `usePrefix` / `useCSP` are memoized per config ref
* perf(date-picker, select, menu): the wrappers forward only the props that are set to `@v-c/picker`, `@v-c/select` and `@v-c/menu` instead of spreading every declared prop (mostly `undefined`) into layers that normalise them again; props normalisation and reactive proxy spreads used to account for about a third of DatePicker mount time
* perf(table): `InternalTable` hands `@v-c/table` referentially stable columns, column transforms and expandable config, and reuses the source column list when no column is `responsive`; these objects used to be rebuilt on every render, which `@v-c/table` treated as a column change and re-rendered every row and cell. Rows and cells now render exactly once per mount, 1000 rows cold mount 439 → 225 ms
* perf(semantic): `classes` / `styles` resolve the merged component props object only for the function form; plain objects no longer pay for a full spread per instance
* perf(form): a `validateDebounce` wait timer is released as soon as a newer event arrives or the item unmounts, so each Form.Item keeps at most one timer instead of one per keystroke
* fix(cssinjs): the 500 ms delayed style-removal timer now lives at module level and no longer retains the unmounted component tree (computeds, DOM refs, app root) through its closure. Heap retained 300 ms after unmounting 1000 Buttons drops from 79 MB to 2.4 MB; the 500 ms delay kept for Transition is unchanged
* perf(vc): `@v-c/trigger` 1.1.6 creates its alignment / position-tracking effects on first open, so closed Triggers no longer hold them; `@v-c/table` 1.3.4 keeps one hover memo per row instead of a computed per cell per render and measures the scrollbar only with `scroll.y` / `sticky`; `@v-c/picker` 1.5.2, `@v-c/select` 1.2.8, `@v-c/menu` 1.4.2 and `@v-c/tooltip` 1.1.4 forward only defined props between their layers and replace per-prop computeds with getter refs. Computeds per instance: Select 329 → 140, DatePicker 367 → 111, Menu item 262 → 70, Table row 47 → 9

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(form): event-driven validation (change / blur / focus) honours `validateDebounce`: `validating` is published right away while the rules run after the wait; `validateFields`, `submit` and rule checks stay immediate ([#981](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/981))
* fix(form): an async validation superseded by a newer one, `clearValidate` or `resetField` no longer writes its stale result; `resetField` no longer swallows the user's next change when the value did not actually change ([#977](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/977))
* fix(table): Shift-clicking the selection checkbox triggers range selection and `rowSelection.onSelect` receives the click event instead of the change event; with `preserveSelectedRowKeys`, `onSelect` / `onSelectAll` / `onSelectMultiple` receive the preserved records that are no longer in the current data (#59449); the fixed selection header `z-index` matches ant-design ([#968](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/968)); scrolling to the first row after pagination, sorting or filtering reads the scroll config merged with ConfigProvider `table.scroll` ([#969](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/969))
* fix(alert): the object form of `closable` supports `onClose` / `afterClose` callbacks and `disabled`, ConfigProvider `alert.closeIcon` takes effect and the ref exposes `nativeElement` ([#971](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/971), #59432); the close button's semantic class is no longer emitted twice and the icon's semantic class matches React (#59384)
* fix(drawer): `extra` renders as a direct child of the header instead of nesting inside `header-title` ([#975](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/975)); the never-implemented `afterOpenChange` event declaration and docs are removed ([#976](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/976))
* fix(descriptions): in bordered mode the semantic `classes` / `styles` apply to the cell instead of the inner `span`, and `attrs.style` is merged in ([#972](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/972)); an empty label / content no longer renders an empty `span` ([#973](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/973))
* fix(color-picker): `class` / `style` and other attrs go to the trigger instead of the panel ([#966](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/966)); clearing the colour no longer emits `change` and `update:value` twice ([#964](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/964)); the `showText` function and slot receive `{ color }` instead of a double-wrapped object ([#962](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/962), [#963](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/963))
* fix(config-provider): the `popupMatchSelectWidth`, `popupOverflow`, `calendar`, `carousel`, `cardMeta`, `ribbon` and `warning` configs reach the components ([#967](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/967))
* fix(date-picker): consume ConfigProvider `datePicker.allowClear` / `clearIcon` ([#970](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/970)); RangePicker reads the `DatePicker` locale instead of the `Calendar` one ([#978](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/978))
* fix(card): fall back to `tabProps.defaultActiveKey` when `defaultActiveTabKey` is not set ([#978](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/978))
* fix(cascader): ConfigProvider `cascader.clearIcon` no longer triggers the deprecated `clearIcon` warning
* fix(dropdown, tooltip, popover): a plain-text or Fragment default slot on the trigger is wrapped in a `span`, so the popup still opens when there is no element to attach events to ([#979](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/979))
* fix(select, dropdown, mentions): the `_InternalPanelDoNotUseOrYouWillBeFired` pure panels no longer leak undeclared attrs onto the wrapper `div` ([#980](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/980))
* fix(float-button): `update:open` is emitted only when the open state actually changes ([#983](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/983))
* fix(flex): ConfigProvider `flex.style` is applied to the rendered style ([#982](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/982))
* fix(carousel): vertical carousels are no longer mirrored in RTL, including when the orientation comes from `dotPlacement` (#59436)
* fix(mentions, tree-select): the empty state calls `renderEmpty` with the correct component names `Mentions` / `TreeSelect` (#59364)
* fix(breadcrumb): menu item links no longer get an `undefined` prefix when there is no `href` (#59423)
* fix(tree): DirectoryTree Shift range selection works again with numeric keys (#59375)
* fix(transfer): removing items in one-way mode clears the right-hand selection (#59428)
* fix(types): resolve the type errors vue-tsc reported in the sources: `useLocale` returns a readonly tuple, and a few internal types in Carousel, Table, Tag, Timeline and FormItem are tightened without runtime changes

**📖 Documentation**

* docs(table): the three `scroll` fields are marked as supporting global config; docs(form): document that the `horizontal` layout stacks labels above controls at viewports of `575px` or less, and how to customise that through the `xs` settings of `labelCol` / `wrapperCol` (#59398, #59417)

**🧰 Infrastructure & Dependencies**

* chore(cssinjs): `@antdv-next/cssinjs` 1.1.0 adds `createGlobalCache` + `useGlobalCacheEntry` (a shareable reactive cache entry plus per-instance reference counting), `createCacheToken`, and the `GlobalCacheEntry` and `UseToken` type exports; `onCacheRemove` callbacks receive the `StyleContextProps` as a third argument so they can be module-level functions instead of closures over the hook scope
* chore(deps): upgrade `@v-c/util` 1.3.2 (adds `pickDefined`), `@v-c/trigger` 1.1.6, `@v-c/picker` 1.5.2, `@v-c/select` 1.2.8, `@v-c/table` 1.3.4, `@v-c/menu` 1.4.2, `@v-c/tooltip` 1.1.4, `@v-c/notification` 2.0.5 (repeated pauses no longer bill the paused span into the elapsed time) and `@v-c/tree-select` 1.1.3
* chore(web-types): the IDE web-types are generated with `global.d.ts` as the single source of tags and cover all 128 global components (25 of them, such as the layout sections, radio, textarea, tab pane and table column, had no entry before, and 17 pseudo tags like `a-参数` were emitted); doc headings resolve to real components, `~~prop~~` rows are marked deprecated, `extends` can omit parent items, and markdown escapes and entities in attribute types are cleaned up (`Record<K, V>` is no longer stripped as an HTML tag); `a-textarea` goes from 3 to 24 attributes and zh descriptions cover 1603 / 1685 attributes; `global.d.ts` declares `AListy`, `ATableColumnGroup`, `ACheckableTagGroup`, `AMentionsOption` and `AMenuDivider` ([#965](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/965))
* chore(perf): add the `tests/perf` reactive-count regression test (computeds / watchers / child components per component instance, failing above the committed baseline), the `pnpm bench` browser benchmark (headless Chrome over CDP, reporting cold / hot mount time, mounted heap, heap retained after unmount and interaction time, with `--profile` recording a CPU profile) and the `VC_LOCAL` alias for testing against local `@v-c/*` builds
* chore(sync): ant-design upstream tracking advances to `820e1a8c2d` (after 6.6.5); incidental deprecated API usages in tests migrate to the current APIs

## V1.5.6

Release Date: 2026-09-25

This release fixes popups that land in the wrong place for one frame when the page carries a global transition style: a common "reduced motion" reset takes effect when the OS asks for reduced motion (e.g. Windows with "Animation effects" turned off), and popups aligned to the right or bottom such as Dropdown, Select and Tooltip used to paint their first frame at the viewport edge before jumping into place. It also upgrades a batch of `@v-c/*` foundation packages: the time panel gains keyboard navigation and screen-reader semantics, Tab and `autoFocus` move focus into the Dropdown menu, and DatePicker's default dayjs config loads in native Node ESM. Collapse `v-model:active-key` now updates, and the Menu event types are exported.

**✨ Features**

* feat(time-picker, date-picker): keyboard navigation in the time panel — Arrow Up / Down move the cursor and skip disabled cells, Enter / Space select it; time columns and cells get `listbox` / `option` semantics with localized labels (via `@v-c/picker` 1.5.0)
* feat(listy): a function `rowKey` receives the item's index in `items` as its second argument; grouping does not change it (via `@v-c/listy` 1.2.0)
* feat(menu): export the `MenuInfo` and `SelectInfo` event types ([#961](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/961), [#693](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/693))

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(trigger): with a global `transition-duration` on the page (e.g. the common `prefers-reduced-motion` reset), right- or bottom-aligned popups (a `bottomRight` Dropdown, a `top` Tooltip, …) no longer paint their first frame at the viewport edge; the Tooltip frame could also make the page briefly scrollable (via `@v-c/trigger` 1.1.5)
* fix(dropdown): pressing Tab while the popup is open moves focus into the menu instead of closing it, also when the menu is wrapped in another element; `autoFocus` now works and focuses without scrolling the page, matching antd (via `@v-c/dropdown` 1.1.1)
* fix(menu): calling `focus()` through the ref no longer throws (via `@v-c/menu` 1.4.1)
* fix(date-picker): the default dayjs config loads in native Node ESM (e.g. when SSR externalizes dependencies) instead of failing with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (via `@v-c/picker` 1.5.0)
* fix(collapse): the `v-model:active-key` binding updates as expected ([#960](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/960))

**📖 Documentation**

* docs(faq): add ["Why do popups have no animation, or flash at the viewport edge before settling?"](/docs/vue/faq#popup-animation-missing-with-reduced-motion), covering how the reduced-motion reset affects popups, the OS settings that trigger it, how to check it and how to fix it

**🧰 Infrastructure & Dependencies**

* chore(deps): upgrade `@v-c/trigger` 1.1.5, `@v-c/util` 1.3.1, `@v-c/menu` 1.4.1, `@v-c/dropdown` 1.1.1, `@v-c/listy` 1.2.0 and `@v-c/picker` 1.5.0. In `@v-c/util`, `dynamicCSS` no longer throws when the page has no `<head>` / `<body>`, and `set` no longer mutates the source object when removing a nested value
* chore(build): the UMD bundles now read the global names of `dayjs` and its plugins and locales from dayjs's own UMD files, so they always match the dayjs builds on the CDN (`@v-c/picker` 1.5.0 imports dayjs plugins with a `.js` extension); the post-build browser bundle check verifies the global every external dependency of the UMD bundles reads, and the build fails on an external without a configured global instead of letting the bundler guess its name

## V1.5.5

Release Date: 2026-09-25

This release advances ant-design upstream tracking to the master after **6.6.5** (`2a04506177`) and starts tracking `ant-design/cssinjs-util`. Table gains resizable columns, Tabs adds `scrollPosition`, Message supports `stack`, and Splitter can animate collapsing; `@antdv-next/cssinjs` 1.0.7 ships alongside it, adding `extraCssVarPrefixCls` to `genStyleHooks` and a CSP `nonce` on CSS variable styles. It also fixes a batch of Vue-adaptation issues: kebab-case `<a-table-column>` attributes being ignored, string / array `style` values throwing, props leaking to the DOM in several components, slots and events not taking effect in Avatar / Alert / Breadcrumb / Cascader / Card and others, and Checkbox / Radio `id`, `name` and `blur` not reaching the native input.

**✨ Features**

* feat(table): columns support `resizable` drag-to-resize with a new `resizeColumn` event `(width, column, columnKey)`, using `minWidth` as the lower bound; group columns do not accept `resizable` and are resized through their leaf columns ([#327](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/327))
* feat(tabs): add `scrollPosition` to control how the active tab is scrolled into view when switching ([#954](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/954), [#916](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/916), #39433)
* feat(message): add the `stack` option, and fix semantic `list` class / style forwarding and the reactivity of holder config ([#927](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/927))
* feat(splitter): add `collapsible.motion`; when enabled, collapsing is animated with the global `motionDurationSlow` and `motionEaseInOut` tokens ([#913](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/913))
* feat(cssinjs): `genStyleHooks` gains an `extraCssVarPrefixCls` option that takes an array or `({ prefixCls, rootCls }) => string[]` to inject component CSS variables for extra classes; the function form is re-evaluated when `prefixCls` changes (ant-design/cssinjs-util#36, #37)

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(table): kebab-case `<a-table-column>` attributes such as `data-index` and `min-width` are now resolved instead of rendering empty cells; a bare `resizable` attribute is treated as `true` ([#945](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/945))
* fix(table): with `preserveSelectedRowKeys`, selecting across pages no longer drops initially selected records from `rowSelection.onChange` ([#881](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/881)); support semantic pagination styling through Table's `pagination.classes` / `pagination.styles` ([#849](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/849)); RTL now comes from ConfigProvider `direction` only, matching ant-design ([#907](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/907)); columns hidden by `responsive` still apply a controlled `filteredValue` ([#886](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/886), #59198)
* fix(card): rename the embedded Tabs class to `ant-card-head-tabs` so style overrides apply again ([#937](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/937)); semantic `classes` / `styles` functions receive the resolved `variant` ([#939](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/939)); the `tabBarExtraContent` slot takes priority over the prop of the same name ([#941](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/941))
* fix(avatar): fall back to `icon` or the default slot when the image fails to load ([#889](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/889)), and reset that fallback when only `srcSet` changes ([#908](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/908)); emit `click` when clicked ([#906](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/906)); expose `nativeElement` via ref and export an `AvatarRef` type ([#909](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/909))
* fix(badge): the horizontal `offset` is no longer flipped under RTL ([#912](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/912)); fractional horizontal offsets are no longer truncated ([#948](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/948), #59314); hide the badge when `text="0"` and `showZero` is not set ([#911](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/911))
* fix(cascader): make the `loadingIcon` prop work and support a `loadingIcon` slot ([#946](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/946)); make the top-level `clearIcon` take effect ([#953](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/953)); stop `dropdownStyle` leaking into DOM attributes ([#952](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/952))
* fix(alert): the `icon` slot is honored instead of always falling back to the default icon ([#898](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/898)); the close animation plays with a custom `prefixCls` ([#899](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/899))
* fix(breadcrumb): emit `clickItem` when an item is clicked ([#928](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/928)); a menu item's `label` takes priority over `title` ([#929](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/929))
* fix(input): no border flash when switching away from the borderless variant at runtime ([#862](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/862), #59269); restore the Input.Password visibility-toggle icon styles ([#938](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/938), #57271)
* fix(input-number): align `allowClear` behavior and clear-icon styles with Input, support ConfigProvider config, and fix the layout with controls, suffix and spinner mode ([#876](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/876), #59251)
* fix(date-picker, time-picker): the `#prefix` slot now renders; complete RangePicker slot types and export `TimeRangePickerSlots`, and warn on the deprecated `addon` slot as well ([#863](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/863))
* fix(upload): `customRequest` and `defaultRequest` types allow returning an `{ abort }` handle (#59382); file names are no longer focusable buttons when no preview handler is registered ([#924](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/924), #59295); `Upload.Dragger` keeps the height from `style` when `height` is unset and applies a numeric `height` in pixels ([#923](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/923), #59319)
* fix(transfer): with search enabled, Shift selection only applies to filtered items ([#947](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/947), #59348); clear stale selections when `dataSource` keys change type ([#886](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/886), #59166); the `footer` callback and slot always receive `{ direction }` ([#922](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/922), #59303)
* fix(tree): DirectoryTree Shift range selection skips `disabled` and `selectable: false` nodes (#59341)
* fix(typography): when editable with a `triggerType` that includes `'text'`, clicking the text starts editing and still emits `click` (#59325)
* fix(checkbox, radio): CheckboxGroup no longer includes removed options' values in `change` / `update:value`, and keeps registration in sync when `value` or `skipGroup` changes ([#894](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/894)); Checkbox and Radio `id` and `name` now reach the native `<input>` and `blur` is emitted, so Form `validateTrigger: 'blur'` works (via `@v-c/checkbox` 1.0.2)
* fix: Result, Message, Notification, Avatar and Modal keep a numeric `0` as custom content instead of falling back to the built-in icon ([#917](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/917), #59153); Form.Item `extra` ([#920](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/920), #59289) and Descriptions `title` / `extra` ([#919](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/919), #59125) render when they are `0`
* fix: string or array `style` values no longer fail or throw in Avatar, Modal, Tree, Transfer and Typography ([#943](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/943)); FloatButton, Listy and Tour widen their `style` type to `StyleValue` ([#955](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/955))
* fix(rate, carousel, collapse): Rate `size` ([#902](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/902)), Carousel `effect` ([#942](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/942)) and the Collapse panel `content` ([#959](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/959)) no longer leak into DOM attributes; Rate `direction` and Carousel `verticalSwiping` are removed from the types, since they always come from ConfigProvider and `vertical` respectively (#59379, #59366)
* fix(color-picker): stop mutating user-provided presets while rendering ([#857](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/857), #59272); when `disabled`, the clear button is no longer clickable, focusable or hover-highlighted ([#886](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/886), #59164)
* fix(notification): `list` / `listContent` semantic classes and styles configured via `useNotification` and ConfigProvider are now applied ([#936](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/936))
* fix(button): `variant="solid"` renders solid primary again instead of falling back to outlined ([#934](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/934))
* fix(tabs): Tabs inherits ConfigProvider `direction`, fixing RTL layout inside `App` ([#884](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/884))
* fix(tour): button callbacks receive the click event ([#949](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/949), #59332)
* fix(anchor): fix external-link navigation, per-link `targetOffset` highlighting, and competing scroll animations on repeated clicks ([#900](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/900))
* fix(auto-complete): `focus()`, `blur()` and `scrollTo()` are available via ref ([#905](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/905))
* fix(splitter): panel sizes respect `min` / `max` again after the container is resized ([#886](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/886), #59084)
* fix(skeleton): numeric element sizes are applied in pixels ([#865](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/865))

* fix(affix): fix the always-`false` style comparison in `lazyUpdatePosition` so scroll frames skip redundant measurement ([#896](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/896))
* fix(theme): `fontHeight`, `fontHeightSM` and `fontHeightLG` follow custom `fontSize` / `lineHeight` tokens ([#918](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/918), #59298)
* fix(tooltip): narrow the `motion` type to the supported `{ name?: string }` ([#926](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/926), #59288)

## V1.5.4

Release Date: 2026-09-10

This release advances ant-design upstream tracking to **6.6.3** (`5d20a26a2b`). InputNumber gains `allowClear` and a fix for `defaultValue` never taking effect; size naming is unified to `medium` (`middle` keeps working); the `@v-c/*` foundation packages are upgraded across the board with Dropdown migrating internally to the `open` / `onOpenChange` API. It also ports a batch of upstream fixes: Modal cancel-button callbacks, mask config being mutated, Segmented selected-text color lag, uncontrolled DirectoryTree expansion, numeric `0` content mistaken for empty, plus locale and accessibility gaps. The test infrastructure moves to Vitest 5.

**✨ Features**

* feat(input-number): add `allowClear` (accepts a `{ clearIcon, disabled, label }` object), a `clearIcon` slot, a `clear` event and a `clear` semantic class / style, with clear-button styles; also fix `defaultValue` never being passed to the underlying component so the initial value was not shown
* feat: unify component size naming on `medium` and update every `middle` usage in docs and demos; Card `size="default"` is deprecated in favor of `medium` ([#810](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/810))
* feat(slider): support `ariaDescribedByForHandle` to link `aria-describedby` on slider handles
* feat(docs): add a `/design.md` page and static file as the single source of design guidance for AI agents

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(modal): keep calling `onCancel` when `cancelButtonProps.onClick` is provided; both handlers now run (#59255)
* fix(modal, drawer): stop writing `closable` back into a user-provided `mask` object, so dialogs sharing one config object no longer affect each other ([#826](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/826), #59233)
* fix(form): prevent `Form.Item` controls from shrinking in vertical layout (#59263)
* fix(table): vertically center cell content in virtual tables (#59260); support empty-string values in tree filters ([#809](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/809), #59141)
* fix(tabs): apply `styles.popup.root` to the "more" dropdown (#59221)
* fix(segmented): switch the selected item's text color in sync with the thumb motion instead of lagging behind (#59046, via `@v-c/segmented` 1.0.5)
* fix(descriptions): preserve item state after reordering when an item's `key` is `0` (#59064)
* fix(tree): DirectoryTree syncs its internal expanded state when `expandedKeys` is not provided, so Shift range selection no longer uses stale state (#59076)
* fix(watermark): skip drawing when the clip size is `0` to avoid zero-sized canvas errors (#59077)
* fix(menu): the horizontal item underline no longer intercepts the pointer, so moving along the bottom edge into a submenu does not close it (#59088)
* fix(drawer): render the header when only `extra` is provided, and treat `0` as a valid `title` / `extra` (#59089)
* fix(alert, empty, statistic): render titles, descriptions, actions, prefixes and suffixes whose content is the number `0` (#59094, #59101)
* fix(skeleton, steps): hide the Skeleton image placeholder SVG from assistive technology; mark the Steps progress icon as a `progressbar` ([#851](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/851), [#819](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/819), #59107, #59073)
* fix(config-provider): nested and isolated theme configs inherit `zeroRuntime` ([#844](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/844), #59250)
* fix(input): Search keeps custom `enterButton` `onMousedown` / `onClick` handlers and no longer fires them twice ([#832](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/832), #59180); Password respects a controlled `visibilityToggle.visible` ([#808](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/808), #59168); Password and Tag ignore key-repeat activations ([#802](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/802), [#803](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/803), #59135, #59134)
* fix(tag): CheckableTag.Group clears the selection when the controlled `value` is `null`
* fix(float-button): add an invisible hover bridge between the trigger and the popup so hover-triggered menus no longer flicker while the pointer moves ([#836](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/836))
* fix(breadcrumb): stop mutating the user-provided `menu` config object ([#842](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/842))
* fix(anchor): align the `click` event signature and parameter names to `(e, link: { title, href })` ([#843](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/843))
* fix(radio): semantic `classes` / `styles` callbacks receive the correct `checked` and `disabled` state ([#815](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/815))
* fix(dropdown, select, cascader, tree-select, auto-complete): `popupRender` may return strings, arrays and other non-element nodes; the type is widened to any `VueNode` ([#817](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/817), #59207)
* fix(date-picker, locale): use `DD.MM.YYYY` field formats for German ([#831](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/831), #59151); fill in year / quarter / month / week placeholders for 32 locales ([#822](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/822), #59219); add localized Carousel prev / next labels to 45 locales ([#823](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/823), #59218); correct Traditional Chinese picker and gradient terms (#59129)

## V1.5.3

Release Date: 2026-08-29

This release advances ant-design upstream tracking to **6.6.2** (`621b63dff5`) and brings in a focused round of stability, typing and accessibility fixes. Component work covers numeric `0` content being mistaken for empty, stale responsive Grid alignment classes, Checkbox disabled-state precedence, Select / AutoComplete popup event forwarding, GIF preview resource cleanup in Upload, Menu collapse transitions and RTL navigation in Image. The documentation site also gains CLI, MCP and AI-agent integration guides and now generates contributor data during the build.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix: render numeric `0` correctly in Breadcrumb separators, Card titles/extras/covers and Meta, FloatButton content, Segmented labels and Tag content; Form labels no longer treat `0` as empty either ([#789](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/789), [#784](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/784), #59117, #59079)
* fix(grid): remove stale alignment classes when responsive `align` / `justify` moves to an unmatched breakpoint or is cleared, instead of retaining an outdated layout state ([#781](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/781), #59066)
* fix(checkbox): resolve `disabled` from Checkbox itself before Checkbox.Group and then the ConfigProvider global context, allowing local settings to override their parent correctly ([#788](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/788), #59109)
* fix(table): preserve custom `keydown` handlers supplied through `onHeaderCell` on sortable headers while retaining built-in keyboard sorting ([#783](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/783), #59078)
* fix(transfer): disable select-all when every visible search result is disabled, avoiding an actionable-looking control that cannot select anything ([#790](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/790), #59121)
* fix(upload): release the temporary canvas after generating a GIF thumbnail so repeated previews do not accumulate unused canvas resources ([#791](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/791), #59137)
* fix(select, auto-complete): stop exposing or forwarding the internal `onPopupVisibleChange` callback through DOM attrs; AutoComplete now emits `openChange` or the compatible `dropdownVisibleChange` according to the listener actually provided ([#792](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/792), #59142)
* fix(tag): give CheckableTag.Group's component-level `classes` / `styles` priority over inherited ConfigProvider semantic config, so local customization is not overwritten globally ([#785](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/785), #59087)
* fix(dropdown, menu): when a hover-triggered Dropdown contains a SubMenu, its root popup now closes normally after the pointer leaves the submenu popup directly for empty page space; also scope the inline-collapse padding-transition override to root menu items so other Menu modes retain their existing animation ([#793](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/793), [#795](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/795), #59085)
* fix(image): pass direction-aware icons into PreviewGroup's merged config so RTL navigation uses a right arrow for previous and a left arrow for next ([#796](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/796), #59145)
* fix(steps): mark Steps panel arrows as decorative and hide them from assistive technology, preventing meaningless screen-reader announcements ([#787](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/787), #59105)
* fix(alert): narrow ConfigProvider's global Alert `closable` option to the type actually supported at runtime, removing properties that were declared but ineffective ([#786](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/786), #59100)

**📖 Documentation**

* docs: add bilingual guides for the CLI, MCP integration and using the component library with AI agents, together with the corresponding documentation navigation
* docs(site): generate static contributor JSON from the GitHub API during the documentation build for a more accurate and stable contributor list ([#779](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/779))
* fix(docs): repair the broken interaction in the Listy drag-sorting demo and add regression coverage ([#770](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/770))
* docs: remove nonexistent `update:open` event entries from the FloatButton, Modal and Tooltip documentation

**🧰 Infrastructure & Dependencies**

* chore(sync): advance ant-design upstream tracking to **6.6.2** at `621b63dff5`, porting the fixes applicable to the Vue implementation in this release
* chore(deps): upgrade `@v-c/menu` to 1.3.1 and `@v-c/trigger` to 1.1.1 to fix hover-triggered menu collapse behavior
* test(transfer): add regression coverage ensuring pagination remains on a valid page after the result set becomes empty ([#782](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/782), #59074)

## V1.5.2

Release Date: 2026-08-21

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync through **6.6.1** and onward to `e216c46b1e`. It focuses on stability and accessibility: Form fixes rapid-validation layout shifts, vertical-layout offsets and conditional children being remounted; Table, Transfer, Anchor and Radio correct duplicate callbacks or interaction semantics; and Carousel, Modal, Notification and Upload gain localized accessible labels. Published packages now also include design-token metadata for direct consumption by theming tools.

**✨ Features**

* feat(build): ship `token.json` and `token-meta.json` under `dist/version`, with `antdv-next/version/token.json` and `antdv-next/version/token-meta.json` export paths for theme editors and design tools
* feat(carousel): localize the default previous/next arrow `aria-label` values through ConfigProvider locale instead of hard-coding English `prev` / `next` (#59014)

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(form): retain the compensated bottom margin while validation errors switch rapidly, preventing form height fluctuation (#59008); preserve Form's `labelCol.offset` in vertical layout (#58981)
* fix(form): keep the FormItem child array shape stable so conditionally rendering a sibling no longer remounts form controls or loses their input and internal state ([#764](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/764))
* fix(form, locale): correct placeholders in the number, string and array `min` validation messages (#58965)
* fix(table): avoid duplicate callbacks when a filter menu closes; preserve caller-controlled close and confirm semantics for custom `filterDropdown`; restore first-row radii when the header is hidden (#59023, #57035)
* fix(transfer): honor component-level `locale.remove` for one-way removal buttons; emit `onSearch` only once when clearing the search input (#58955, #59016)
* fix(upload): preserve files added while an asynchronous removal is pending; use localized `title` and `aria-label` values for preview, download and remove actions ([#724](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/724), #58953)
* fix(radio): fire an option's own `onChange` before the group-level `change` when Radio.Group renders from `options` ([#716](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/716))
* fix(anchor): avoid duplicate `change` emissions when `getCurrentAnchor` is provided while retaining reactive tracking inside the function (#58834)
* fix(menu): prevent Tooltip flashes when an inline menu collapses while hovered, remove icon jitter during collapse, and resolve the conflicting `SubMenuProps.title` type (#58865, #59018, [#759](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/759))
* fix(color-picker): keep color selection draggable after clearing; apply trigger description text styling from `styles.description` instead of mistakenly reading `classes.description` (#58995)
* fix(float-button): keep the BackTop scroll-progress ring visible whenever the button is shown (#58982)
* fix(notification, modal): localize close-button names and pass the global locale to the static Notification API; restore the default `24px` bottom offset instead of mistakenly using the `4.5`-second default duration ([#756](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/756), #58957)
* fix(collapse, date-picker): hide decorative collapse arrows and range separators from screen readers to prevent duplicate announcements ([#741](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/741), [#740](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/740))
* fix(tree): handle a node key of `0` correctly in DirectoryTree range selection ([#757](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/757))
* fix(select): keep customized inputs aligned while hovering the clear button ([#727](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/727))

**💄 Styles**

* fix(listy): improve virtual scrollbar track hover feedback (#58964)

**📖 Documentation**

* docs(listy): add a drag-sorting demo; add a Select multiple-fields search demo ([#768](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/768))
* fix(docs): prevent demo edits from being reverted after lazy HTTP loading and isolate each demo's TypeScript / JavaScript toggle state ([#765](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/765), [#766](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/766))
* docs: sync upstream API tables and heading anchors, clarify Form label association, Alert accessibility and the Transfer locale default, and add a Qixi festival easter-egg page

**🧰 Infrastructure & Dependencies**

* chore(sync): sync ant-design **6.6.1** and subsequent changes through `e216c46b1e`
* chore(deps): upgrade `@v-c/select` to 1.2.4 and `@v-c/pagination` to 1.1.1
* build: generate the docs site's `antd.css` at build time instead of committing the generated asset; update tsdown external-dependency configuration for the newer API

## V1.5.1

Release Date: 2026-08-14

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync to **6.6.0** (`a5bbbf962d`, [#703](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/703), [#710](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/710)). Two main threads: the full 6.6.0 sync — `nativeElement` refs across ~20 components, Tree `scrollTo` auto-expand, Table expandable `forceRender`, a BackTop scroll-progress ring, global tooltip delays and input variant config via ConfigProvider — and a focused round of **Form fixes and enhancements**: rule resolution and duplicate-validation fixes, aria attributes, and render-function validation messages — `message` now accepts a render function, so displayed errors update reactively on locale switch without re-validating.

**✨ Features**

* feat: expose `nativeElement` refs on ~20 components — Avatar.Group, Badge.Ribbon, Breadcrumb, Calendar, Card.Grid, Card.Meta, Carousel, Descriptions, Divider, Empty, FloatButton.Group, QRCode, Result, Skeleton, Space.Compact, Spin, Splitter, Transfer and Watermark — with the ref types exported from the entry (#58627~#58667)
* feat(form): rule `message` accepts a render function `() => VueNode`; it is kept as-is through validation and only invoked while rendering the error, so any reactive state it reads (locale, i18n, ...) updates the displayed message without re-running validators; works with form-level and computed `rules` as well ([#714](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/714))
* feat(tree): `scrollTo` supports `autoExpand`, add `Tree.useTree` and export `TreeInstance` / `UseTreeConfig` (#58841)
* feat(table): support `forceRender` for expandable rows (#58860)
* feat(float-button): BackTop gains `showProgress`, rendering scroll progress as a ring (#58894)
* feat(pagination): add `components.sizeChanger` to customize the size changer (#58831)
* feat(mentions): support `popupRender` to customize the dropdown (#58582)
* feat(input): ConfigProvider variant config supports the `inputSearch` / `inputPassword` / `otp` subcomponents, each resolving its own config first (#58784)
* feat(tooltip, popover, popconfirm): `mouseEnterDelay` / `mouseLeaveDelay` configurable globally via ConfigProvider (#58892)
* feat(theme): add the `focusOutline` seed token for shared focus styles, honored by Input, Select, Rate, Splitter and Steps; Alert gains a `borderRadius` component token (#58647, #58708, #57765)
* feat(image): preview supports `wheel` to control mouse-wheel zoom (`@v-c/image@1.1.0`, #58728)
* feat(border-beam): add `count` to configure the number of beams, evenly distributed (#58691)
* feat(locale): add Albanian `sq_AL`; refine Traditional Chinese terminology and use Taiwan week wording in DatePicker (#58618, #58947, #58951)

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(form): rules combining `required` and `type` no longer run type validation twice; FormItem `required` no longer derives a validation rule and only drives the required mark, aligning with antd
* fix(form): function rules resolve with the form instance as argument and are re-resolved on every validation, so they can read the latest external state
* fix(form): form controls now carry `aria-required` and link help and error text via `aria-describedby`
* fix(table): an explicitly placed `Table.EXPAND_COLUMN` no longer loses its identity through `ref()` / `reactive()` proxies, removing the phantom empty column (`@v-c/table@1.2.0`)
* fix(tree-select): preserve the selection state of disabled child nodes (`@v-c/tree-select@1.1.2`)
* fix(select): the clear icon is reachable by keyboard (`@v-c/select@1.2.1`)
* fix(virtual-list): `scrollTo({ key })` resolves against the latest data and retries after a data update (`@v-c/virtual-list@1.1.1`)
* fix(carousel): keep the current slide when children are added instead of resetting to the first (#58845)
* fix(drawer): support a disabled close button (#58853)
* fix: correct semantic style priority — ConfigProvider's root `style` now sits between context styles and component styles across 20+ components including Badge, Calendar, ColorPicker, DatePicker, Drawer, Dropdown and Modal; also fixes Divider spreading the whole semantic styles object onto its root, Masonry dropping component-level `styles.root`, and the message Holder merge order (#58550, #58564)
* fix(config-provider): the `inputSearch` component config previously never reached the context and was silently dead; it now applies
* fix(typography): restore the interactive ellipsis tooltip — hovering the popup no longer dismisses it (#58661, #58722)
* fix(button): align loading icon styles, dropping the redundant centering and block declarations (#58712)
* fix(types): export the missing `UploadRef`, `StatisticRef` and `SliderRef` types (#58700, #58798)
* fix(site): harden mainland China detection for the docs site switch

**💄 Styles**

* fix(select, table, tree): virtual scrollbars gain `cursor: pointer` and hover feedback (#58658, #58679)

**📖 Documentation**

* docs: add the design system documentation ([#707](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/707)) and refresh the getting-started guide
* feat(docs): support multi-file demo tabs in the code panel
* docs: add demos for Avatar `overflowInFinal`, reactive Form validation messages and Tabs `more.popupRender`; document the Image preview `wheel` prop

**🧰 Dependencies**

* chore(sync): sync ant-design **6.6.0** upstream changes ([#703](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/703), [#710](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/710))
* chore(deps): upgrade `@v-c/virtual-list@1.1.1`, `@v-c/tree@1.2.0`, `@v-c/select@1.2.1`, `@v-c/tree-select@1.1.2`, `@v-c/table@1.2.0`, `@v-c/image@1.1.0`
* refactor: Button's delayed loading, Slider's tooltip toggle, Upload's progress reveal and Typography's copy feedback all move onto the shared `useDelayState` (#58690)

## V1.5.0

Release Date: 2026-08-07

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync to **6.5.4** (`5ade9944d6`) and introduces the experimental **Listy** virtual-list component. Listy targets long and grouped lists with virtual scrolling, sticky group headers, semantic styling and imperative scrolling, while BorderBeam gains controls for animation duration, beam width and beam size. It also fixes Layout Sider custom triggers, controlled Segmented values, invalid Checkbox options, reduced-motion behavior in BackTop and more.

**✨ Features**

* feat(listy): add the experimental Listy component with standard and virtual lists, grouped data and sticky headers, infinite-loading scenarios, semantic `classes` / `styles`, and a `scrollTo` API for scrolling to a position, item or group ([#670](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/670))
* feat(border-beam): add `duration`, `lineWidth` and `size` to control animation duration, beam width and beam size respectively; add demos for these options and custom containers

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(layout): support both a `trigger` prop and slot on Layout Sider; restore the default trigger when neither is supplied, and allow an explicit `null` to hide it
* fix(segmented): in controlled mode, keep the selected item on the controlled value when the consumer does not update `value` after `change`, instead of incorrectly switching to the clicked item; upgrade the primitive to `@v-c/segmented@1.0.4`
* fix(alert): an object-valued `closable` now enables closing even when it does not provide `closeIcon`
* fix(checkbox): Checkbox Group ignores `null` / `undefined` options and options without a valid `value`, avoiding invalid checkbox items
* fix(float-button): BackTop jumps to the top without animation when the user enables `prefers-reduced-motion`; the shared `scrollTo` utility now also supports zero-duration scrolling and cancellation of unfinished animations
* fix(app): with CSS variables and `component={false}`, only warn when root classes or styles would actually be dropped (#58876)
* fix(border-beam): fall back to default border information when `getComputedStyle` throws on the host element, preventing BorderBeam from breaking the component tree
* fix(types): correct the DatePicker semantic return value and Tour `actionsRender` declarations to match the actual component-level APIs

**📖 Documentation**

* docs(listy): add Chinese and English component docs with demos for basic usage, virtual scrolling, grouping, imperative scrolling, rich content, infinite loading and semantic styling
* perf(docs): load component demo source only when the code panel is expanded, so the browser no longer parses every demo's source and highlighted output during page initialization; development HMR remains supported and loaded source is reused across collapse and re-expand

**🧰 Dependencies**

* chore(sync): sync upstream changes from ant-design **6.5.4**
* chore(deps): add `@v-c/listy@1.0.2` and upgrade `@v-c/picker` to 1.3.2 ([#684](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/684)), `@v-c/segmented` to 1.0.4 and `@v-c/table` to 1.1.9

## V1.4.6

Release Date: 2026-08-03

This release advances the ant-design sync from **6.5.1** all the way past **6.5.3** (`49c4a03cc9`) and upgrades all twelve `@v-c/*` primitives ([#668](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/668), [#678](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/678), [#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681)).

Two threads are worth calling out. The first is the **RangePicker interaction refactor**: upstream fixed "an unconfirmed range must not be submitted on blur" inside `@rc-component/picker`, so we rewrote the whole interaction state machine in `@v-c/picker@1.3.0`, which lands here with the dependency bump. The second is the chain of adjustments that followed **turning the clear affordance from a `<span>` into a `<button>`** — the browser's default control chrome had to be reset, the button had to become visible and outlined under keyboard focus, and a suffix holding focus must not be hidden. antd has not caught up here yet (its `rc-select` still renders a non-focusable `<span>`), so this repo carries the accessibility work first.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(date-picker): blur no longer submits an unconfirmed partial range when using `showTime` with `allowEmpty`. Comes from the RangePicker interaction-flow refactor in `@v-c/picker@1.3.0`, where every interaction is resolved into a single action before anything executes, so event sources no longer submit or reset values on their own ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58803)
* fix(slider): `onFocus` / `onBlur` no longer fire more than once. Vue's `cloneVNode` merges `on*` props into an array and invokes each one — React's `cloneElement` overwrites — so an explicit dispatch on top of that duplicated the callback. The two paths are also asymmetric: `@v-c/slider`'s `Handle` declares `onFocus` as a prop but never `onBlur` ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58711)
* fix(table): selecting all data no longer picks up disabled rows on other pages. It relied on `checkboxPropsMap`, which only covers the current page, so records elsewhere had no `disabled` entry and read as selectable ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58843)
* fix(table): keep `dataIndex` accessible on the columns union ([#673](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/673))
* fix(transfer): deselect-all is correct while filtering. It compared key counts, but filtering narrows the keys to the visible items, so a fully-checked list read as unchecked ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58844)
* fix(transfer): preserve the disabled state of custom actions ([#668](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/668), #58718)
* fix(input): `Input.OTP` no longer renders the original value when `mask` is a string — the mask overlay was effectively doing nothing — and an explicitly supplied `type` now wins over the mask-derived one ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58805, #58835)
* fix(input): hide the `Input.TextArea` resize handle on touch devices ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58812)
* fix(select): suffix icons and selected content no longer overlap the clear icon under custom theme colours ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58581)
* fix(select): the clear button is reachable by keyboard — visible and outlined on focus, and a custom suffix holding focus is no longer hidden. The clear affordance is a focusable `<button>` now, and `pointer-events: none` does not take it out of the tab order ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681))
* fix(auto-complete): the disabled text colour now reaches the input — it has to be set through the CSS variable rather than `color`, which never reaches a customized input ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58838)
* fix(spin): a standalone `Spin` nested inside another one is no longer pulled out of flow by the outer centring styles ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58801)
* fix(typography): the editable textarea's font size now matches the content being edited ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58551)
* fix(upload): default download links open with `noopener`, so newly opened tabs can no longer reach the opener page ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58817)

**💄 Styles**

* fix(date-picker, select): reset the browser's default button chrome on the clear icon. It is a `<button>` now, so without the reset its grey background, border, padding and own font showed through ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58403)
* fix: bare `<svg>` icons from third-party libraries now sit vertically centred with their labels in Tabs, Segmented, Breadcrumb, Collapse and Tag. An `<svg>` has no baseline of its own, so it is aligned by its bottom margin edge and rides above the text; `display: inline-block` additionally keeps it aligned under a reset that forces `svg { display: block }`, such as Tailwind Preflight ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681), #58847, #58862, #58868, #58869, #58870; Tag via [#668](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/668), #58723)
* fix(style): complete the Icon base styles when `theme.zeroRuntime` or CSS layers are enabled ([#678](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/678), #58763)
* fix(style): respect the `lineType` token in Button, ColorPicker, Select and Space borders ([#668](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/668), #58755)
* fix(tree): respect the `margin-inline-start` design token in `showLine` ([#668](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/668), #58745)
* fix(table): preserve the nested table's top border inside custom content ([#668](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/668), #58746)

**📖 Documentation**

* docs(faq): note that in-DOM template lowercasing breaks camelCase slots on CDN ([#671](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/671))
* feat(docs): supplement the Upload demo
* docs: add a Collapse panel-icon demo rendered through the `labelRender` slot, covering third-party bare `<svg>` icons ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681))
* docs: fix the English introduction and release blog links

**🧰 Infrastructure**

* chore: upgrade all twelve `@v-c/*` dependencies — util 1.1.0, trigger 1.1.0, tooltip 1.1.0, menu 1.3.0, dropdown 1.0.5, select 1.2.0, tabs 1.3.0, mentions 1.2.0, input-number 1.0.7, tree 1.1.3, pagination 1.1.0, picker 1.3.0 ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681))
* test: regenerate snapshots in a UTC+8 timezone. Some had absorbed the generating machine's timezone and reported spurious failures elsewhere ([#681](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/681))

## V1.4.5

Release Date: 2026-07-21

Hotfix for the browser (CDN) bundles shipped in 1.4.4. The UMD/ESM builds referenced `process.env.NODE_ENV`, which does not exist in the browser, so loading `dist/antd.js` from unpkg/jsdelivr threw `ReferenceError: process is not defined` and the whole bundle failed. Fixing that surfaced a second problem: `app.use(window.antd)` never registered any components because the plugin's `install` was nested one level deeper on the global.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(build): define `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the browser-facing bundles (`antd.js`, `antd.esm.js`, `antd-with-locales.js`, `antd-with-locales.esm.js`) so they no longer reference the missing `process` global. The bundler entry (`dist/index.js`) is left untouched so tree-shaking consumers keep their own dev/prod branches ([#667](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/667), fixes [#666](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/666))
* fix(build): expose `install` / `setPrefix` as named exports so the UMD/ESM global (`window.antd`) carries `install` at the top level; `app.use(window.antd)` now registers all components directly, without reaching for `window.antd.default` ([#667](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/667))

**🧰 Infrastructure**

* build: add a post-build check that fails the build if any browser bundle references the `process` global unguarded, preventing this regression from shipping again ([#667](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/667))

## V1.4.4

Release Date: 2026-07-20

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync past **6.5.1** to `78c3d84619` ([#658](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/658), [#664](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/664)). Its main theme is **APIs that were declared and documented but never actually wired up**: Form `getFieldInstance` always returned `undefined`, Timeline's three render props were ignored, and Tree's `rootStyle` was silently discarded. It also makes the style and token build scripts read component sources directly instead of bundled output.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(form): `getFieldInstance(name)` now returns the rendered control instance instead of always returning `undefined`. The registry key no longer goes through `getFieldId`, so lookups work whether or not the Form declares a `name`, and `focusField` now prefers the control's own `focus()` before falling back to the DOM node ([#665](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/665), fixes [#663](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/663))
* fix(timeline): wire up the `dotRender` / `labelRender` / `contentRender` props and slots — they were declared and documented but ignored by `useItems`, and leaked into the Steps pass-through. Slot results are normalized so a conditional slot that renders nothing correctly falls back to the item's `icon` / `title` / `content` ([#656](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/656), fixes [#653](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/653))
* fix(tabs): `labelRender` / `contentRender` now infer their item type from `items` instead of hard-coding `TabItem`, and `InstanceType<typeof Tabs>` keeps the exposed `TabsRef` ([#661](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/661), fixes [#660](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/issues/660))
* fix(tree): restore `rootStyle` compatibility — it was inherited from the underlying props but silently overwritten by the semantic root style, making it a no-op. It now works again and is deprecated in favour of `styles.root` (#58709)
* fix(input): a custom Search `enterButton` now syncs `disabled` with the form context, and a `loading` supplied on the custom Button is no longer overwritten (#58726)
* fix(grid): support zero `flex` values — `:flex="0"` and responsive `:xs="{ flex: 0 }"` were dropped by a truthiness check (#58719)
* fix(tag): closing a link tag no longer triggers navigation (#58720)
* fix(splitter): correct percentage-based ARIA value ranges (#58702)
* fix(style): respect the `lineWidth` / `lineType` border tokens in Typography, Tree, Collapse and Layout instead of hardcoding `1px solid`; the rendered CSS is unchanged at the default theme and only differs once those tokens are customized (#58740, #58741, #58742, #58743)
* fix(segmented, radio): drop downstream-only `prefers-reduced-motion` styles that upstream never had, restoring parity with the React sources ([#654](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/654))
* fix(wave): avoid touching global `window` in the `attachListener` watch callback, which runs on Vue's async scheduler and could fire after the environment is torn down ([#662](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/662))

**📖 Docs**

* docs(timeline): add a `dotRender` demo ([#656](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/656))
* docs(input-number): add a feedback suffix debug demo (#58703)
* docs(anchor): correct the `offsetTop` default value (#58710)
* docs(select): preserve the typed search text in the remote users demo (#58736)
* docs(table): fix the English API links ([#657](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/657))

**🧰 Infrastructure**

* refactor(build): `build:style` and `build:token-statistic` now load component sources through a vite SSR runner instead of importing `dist/components.js`, so a stale build can no longer produce outdated CSS or token statistics. Both outputs were verified identical to the dist-based runs ([#654](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/654))

## V1.4.3

Release Date: 2026-07-15

Hotfix for a style regression introduced in 1.4.2 while syncing upstream [ant-design#58685](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/pull/58685): after `genNoMotionStyle` expanded to `&::before / &::after`, six call sites that already live inside pseudo-element selectors produced invalid double pseudo-element selectors such as `.ant-border-beam::before::before` — browsers silently drop these rules (so `prefers-reduced-motion` never took effect there), and lightningcss-based static CSS minification fails the build outright.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(style): add a flat `genNoMotionRawStyle` variant and use it at the six pseudo-element call sites in Switch / Segmented / Radio / Checkbox / BorderBeam, removing the invalid `::before::before` selectors and restoring `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior there ([#651](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/651))

**🧰 Infrastructure**

* ci: bump node to 24 in GitHub Actions workflows
* chore: regenerate the static style output

## V1.4.2

Release Date: 2026-07-14

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync to **6.5.1** ([#644](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/644), [#647](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/647), [#650](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/650)) and focuses on **TypeScript type infrastructure** (generic constructor exports, type inference in `h()` usage). It also fixes a batch of component issues — Switch label centering and bare attribute parsing, AutoComplete filled background stacking, Modal lazy rendering — and upgrades `@v-c/table` 1.1.8, `@v-c/util` 1.0.21 and other dependencies.

**✨ Features**

* fix(switch, checkbox): bare `checked` / `default-checked` template attributes now correctly resolve to `true` (previously parsed as an empty string and rendered unchecked)
* fix(input): prevent the Search button focus outline from being covered by adjacent elements (#58615)
* fix(auto-complete): avoid duplicate filled background on custom input components (#58669)
* fix(motion): `prefers-reduced-motion` now also disables transitions/animations on `::before` / `::after` pseudo elements (#58685)

* fix(pagination): keep the size changer width inside Form.Item
* fix(button): align icons inside Card extra
* fix(descriptions): restore view width in shrink-to-fit containers
* fix(date-picker): expose `nativeElement` as an element instead of a function
* fix(config-provider): component-level `classes` / `styles` config is no longer silently inferred as `any` ([#642](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/642)); force `zeroRuntime` when the cssinjs layer is enabled
* fix(locale): complete missing locale fields
* fix(types): fix lost contextual callback types in `h()` usage, unresolvable `h(Table, props)`, and clean up remaining type errors in component sources
* fix(deps): bump `@v-c/util` to 1.0.21, fixing Select dropdown misalignment inside Space.Compact under vue 3.5.39

## V1.4.1

Release Date: 2026-07-02

This release mainly fixes **vue 3.5.39 compatibility issues** ([vuejs/core#14985](https://github.com/vuejs/core/pull/14985) changed when function refs are invoked): overlay components (Tooltip/Popover/Popconfirm/Dropdown) mis-positioning and dropping the first-open animation, message/notification notices stacking on top of each other, and Masonry layout breakage. It also adds a component meta block to the component doc pages and refines the icon overview.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix: fix overlay components mis-positioning / losing the first-open animation under the vue 3.5.39 production build (Tooltip / Popover / Popconfirm / Dropdown) — via `@v-c/trigger` 1.0.18 (#623)
* fix: fix **message / notification notices stacking** on top of each other under vue 3.5.39 (first-frame height measurement failed) — via `@v-c/notification` 2.0.2 (#623)
* fix(masonry): fix Masonry layout breakage caused by failed item height measurement under vue 3.5.39; resolve via `createElementRef` (#623)
* fix(deps): add `@v-c/notification` to overrides to drop the stale version left in the lockfile

**📖 Docs**

* docs: add a component meta block (import / feedback / docs / version) to component doc pages, aligning with ant-design
* docs(icon): categorize the newly added AI / brand icons under the brand group, tag them as "added in 1.4.0", and surface them first

**🧪 Tests**

* test(drawer): add a regression test for Watermark inheritance inside Drawer (vue 3.5.39)

**🧰 Dependencies**

* chore(deps): bump vue to `^3.5.39`; `@v-c/trigger` 1.0.18, `@v-c/notification` 2.0.2, `@v-c/util` 1.0.20 and related toolchain deps

## V1.4.0

Release Date: 2026-06-30

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync to **6.5.0**, bringing a batch of new features and semantic capabilities: **Modal `scrollLock`**, **Dropdown left/right placements**, **Steps `maxCount` collapsing**, **Slider per-handle disabling (`boolean[]` in Range mode)**, **DatePicker/RangePicker `clear` event**, **Watermark per-line fonts**, **Layout Sider semantic `classes`/`styles`** and **Tabs `body` semantic structure**; it also unifies the **root semantic style priority** across 30+ components. Multiple upstream fixes are synced as well, and the `@v-c` chain is upgraded (picker 1.2.0 / select 1.1.3 / tabs 1.2.1).

## V1.3.7

Release Date: 2026-06-25

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync to **6.4.5** and backfills the missing fixes (#58234 / #58214 / #58314 / #58371 / #58339), makes **Tabs panes mount lazily**, fixes **Pagination not emitting the update event in some scenarios** and **Table overriding the consumer's `components.header.table` when merging aria props**, and upgrades the `@v-c` chain (table 1.1.6 cell memo, virtual-list 1.0.9 height perf) for better performance.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix: sync ant-design upstream changes (6.4.4 → 6.4.5) — [#613](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/613)

**🧰 Dependencies**

* chore(deps): upgrade the `@v-c` chain — table 1.1.6 (cell memo) + virtual-list 1.0.9 (height perf) — [#609](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/609)
* chore: upgrade dependencies

## V1.3.6

Release Date: 2026-06-18

This release fixes **Segmented rendering an empty icon node for options without an icon**, **Dropdown not forwarding `menu`'s `classes` / `styles` / `rootClass`** and **Input emitting a duplicate `class` attribute**, relaxes the Form form-level `rules` type to a recursive `RulesMap`, and refines the DirectoryTree typing while bumping dependencies.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(segmented): no longer render an empty `.ant-segmented-item-icon` node for options without an `icon`, aligning with React ant-design (#600) — [#601](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/601)
* fix(dropdown): forward `menu`'s `classes` / `styles` / `rootClass` to the overlay Menu instead of having them overridden by the explicit semantic classes (#599) — [#601](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/601)
* fix(input): fix the duplicate `class` attribute

**🔧 Types**

* refactor(form): relax the form-level `rules` type to a recursive `RulesMap` so nested (`{ user: { email: [...] } }`) and indexed (`{ list: { 0: [...] } }`) configs type-check without casts — [#601](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/601)
* perf(tree): refine DirectoryTree typing

## V1.3.5

Release Date: 2026-06-13

This release fixes **Form.Item triggering a no-op meta update with a fresh meta object on every focus/blur, re-rendering its child** — combined with inline object props (e.g. `:show-time`) this reset DatePicker's in-panel draft selection, making the OK confirm impossible inside a-form-item — and bumps `@v-c/picker` for the companion fix.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(form): skip no-op meta updates to avoid re-rendering FormItem children (fixes DatePicker in-panel draft selection being reset inside a-form-item) — [#597](https://github.com/antdv-next/antdv-next/pull/597)

**🧰 Dependencies**

* chore(deps): bump `@v-c/picker` to ^1.1.3 for the companion fix where a parent re-render passing equivalent-but-new props reset the draft selection (antdv-next #597)
* chore: update the docs-site css

## V1.3.4

Release Date: 2026-06-12

This release advances the ant-design upstream sync to **6.4.4 (`b32376a31b`)** — back-fills every fix and companion test missed from the 6.4.4 changelog, **adds a "Global Config" column to every component API doc** and simplifies the ConfigProvider component-config section. It also introduces the **Form `useForm` / `useFormInstance`** hooks, fixes **popup misplacement under transformed ancestors** and the **Enter key mis-selecting on dropdown open in Select**, and bumps the `@v-c/*` dependencies to their released sync versions.

**✨ Features**

## V1.3.0

Release Date: 2026-05-16

This release focuses on **syncing ant-design to 6.4.2, introducing the new BorderBeam component, migrating Notification / Message / Typography to antd v2 semantic structure, and expanding ConfigProvider coverage**, while also fixing **TypeScript bundler deep-subpath type resolution, Message transition mismatch, Notification close button spacing when title is empty, and Image popup.close semantic key naming**.

> ⚠️ This release contains breaking changes — see the **Breaking Changes** section below.

**✨ Features**

* feat: sync ant-design@6.4.2, covering Calendar / Splitter / Image / Wave / Modal / Drawer / ConfigProvider / Table / Tabs / Form / Menu / Tag / Tree / Tour / Typography / Notification / Message
* feat(border-beam): introduce the BorderBeam glow border component with docs, demos, and unit tests
* feat(typography): migrate to antd 6.4 v2 semantic structure; add `actions.placement` for action button group position; new `root` / `actions` / `action` / `textarea` semantic keys
* feat(notification): upgrade to vc-notification@2 with full v2 semantic slots `title` / `description` / `icon` / `actions` / `progress` / `close`; add `_InternalListDoNotUseOrYouWillBeFired` internal component for doc previews
* feat(message): sync antd 6.4 v2 semantic structure (`title` / `wrapper` / `list` / `listContent`); add `_InternalListDoNotUseOrYouWillBeFired`
* feat(form): add `help` / `helpItem` / `extra` semantic class and style support
* feat(transfer): add nested `source` / `target` semantic overrides — customize `section` / `header` / `title` / `body` / `list` / `item` / `itemIcon` / `itemContent` / `footer` per side
* feat(calendar): add `itemContent` semantic class and style
* feat(modal, tour, tag, popconfirm, image, statistic, tree, tree-select, input, popconfirm): add `close` / `icon` / `clear` / `value` / `itemSwitcher` semantic class/style support
* feat(config-provider): extend global component config for Select `allowClear` / `showSearch` / `loadingIcon`, DatePicker / TimePicker `allowClear` / `clearIcon`, Modal infoIcon/successIcon/warningIcon/errorIcon, Upload `progress` / `accept`, Modal / Drawer `focusable`, Mentions `allowClear`, Cascader icons, and more
* feat(menu): refresh item extra layout and tooltip padding
* feat(mentions): wire the popup z-index through `useZIndex`
* feat(cascader): support ConfigProvider `searchIcon` / `clearIcon` / `removeIcon` / `suffixIcon`
* feat(table): support ConfigProvider column defaults with per-column merge
* feat: upgrade vc-notification@2.0.0-rc.4, vc-input@1.1.0-rc.3, vc-picker@1.1.0-rc.3, vc-table@1.1.0-rc.2, vc-select@1.1.0-rc.1, vc-slider@1.1.0-rc.1, vc-resize-observer@1.1.0-rc.1, vc-tour@1.1.0-rc.2 etc.

**💥 Breaking Changes**

* **typography**: `classes.copy` / `classes.edit` / `classes.expand` / `classes.content` (and matching `styles.*`) are removed. Migrate to the unified `classes.action` / `styles.action` (single action button) and `classes.actions` / `styles.actions` (actions container).
* **message**: `classes.content` / `styles.content` are removed — use `classes.title` / `styles.title` instead. DOM moves from `notice-description > .custom-content` to `notice-title`, and the type modifier class moves from the root to `notice-wrapper`.
* **transfer**: `classes.source` / `classes.target` change from flat strings to nested objects. The old `classes={ source: 'foo' }` becomes `classes={ source: { section: 'foo' } }`.
* **image**: `classes.popup.closeIcon` / `styles.popup.closeIcon` are renamed to `popup.close` / `popup.close`, aligning with the underlying vc-image naming.

**🐞 Fixes**

* fix(pkg): add `index.d.ts` fallback to the `./dist/*` subpath exports — resolves TypeScript `moduleResolution: bundler` / `nodenext` failing to resolve deep type imports
* fix(message): switch the transition class from `move-up` to `fade`, restoring antd 6.x enter/leave animation
* fix(message): promote the icon from inline description into the v2 icon semantic slot
* fix(notification): pad description with `padding-inline-end` when the notice is closable but has no title — prevents the close button from overlapping description text
* fix(notification): position via `--notification-top` / `--notification-bottom` CSS variables to stop the holder from spanning full height
* fix(notification, message): re-add the v1 icon-wrapper class for backward compatibility
* fix(notification): in vc-notification, drop the broken onClose array merge and the invalid TransitionGroup tag (vc-notification 2.0.0-rc.2/rc.3 follow-ups)
* fix(border-beam): adjust the `offsetPath` corner radius from `200px` to `100px` so the beam no longer breaks at corners

**📝 Documentation & Demos**

* docs: add Notification / Message / Typography / Form / Transfer / Tag / Tour / Modal / Image / Calendar / Statistic / Tree / TreeSelect / Input / Popconfirm semantic DOM preview demos with bilingual locale copy
* docs(notification, message): refactor the style-class demo to match React 6.4's green/red function-style example
* docs(border-beam): add zh-CN / en-US component docs, demos, and sidebar registration

**🔄 Internal**

* upgrade vc-notification to 2.0.0-rc.4 (full v2 semantic structure + height patcher fix + leave animation fix)
* bump vc-input / vc-picker / vc-select / vc-table / vc-slider / vc-resize-observer / vc-tour / vc-notification rc versions — see catalog for details
* upgrade vc-overflow to 1.1.0-rc.1 (RTL logical offset fix)
